I'm Youssef Hammad, I'm 19 years old (at the time i'm typing this). Egyptian, lived my whole life in Saudi Arabia, and currently studying Software Engineering at Asia Pacific University in Malaysia.

## My Experience With Programming.
I've been self-studying for 5 years, during which i've learned about JavaScript, Python, Java and C. When I was first introduced to programming in Javascript, i made an [regular-shapes area calculator](https://github.com/j0eTheRipper/area_calculator), When I was introduced to Python, I made some simple projects (mini calculator, and guessing games, etc...), but the ones i'm most proud of are... 

- [library management web application](https://github.com/j0eTheRipper/library_webapp) in Flask, 

- [calendar automation](https://github.com/j0eTheRipper/apu_calendar_automation) web application, React + Flask (I just added react because i was trying to learn how it works...). 

- I've also made a disgustingly simple [tetris-like-game](https://github.com/j0eTheRipper/tetrish) in PyGame.

- python script that [arranges](https://github.com/j0eTheRipper/arranger) files in the downloads directory (or the directory you specify)
