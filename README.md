## Bio
I'm Youssef Hammad, I'm a professional data analyst who likes to code for fun.

### Case Studies
I've made a study about the differences between casual customers and annual members for a bike sharing company called cyclistic (it's an immaginary company).
[check it out](https://github.com/j0eTheRipper/cyclistic-case-study).

So far I've compleated one case study, it doesn't really show off my programming skills like the other projects I've made, but it does highlight my analytical skills.

### Coding Projects - Python
I've made some coding projects here and there -- again just for fun -- but the project I'm proud of the most, and the one that I think reflects my skills, is the [arrange](https://github.com/j0eTheRipper/arrange) project.
