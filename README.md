## Bio
I'm Youssef Hammad, I'm a data analyst, and a programmer

### Case Studies
I've made a study about the differences between casual customers and annual members for a bike sharing company called cyclistic (it's an immaginary company).
[check it out](https://github.com/j0eTheRipper/cyclistic-case-study).

So far I've compleated one case study, it doesn't really show off my programming skills like the other projects I've made, but it does highlight my analytical skills.

### Coding Projects
I've made many coding projects, but the one that i'm really proud of and which i think really reflects my skills is the [arrange](https://github.com/j0eTheRipper/arrange) project.
