## Bio
I'm Youssef Hammad, I'm a professional data analyst who likes to code for fun.

I've made some coding projects here and there -- again just for fun -- but the project I'm proud of the most, and the one that I think reflects my skills, is the [arrange](https://github.com/j0eTheRipper/arrange) project.
